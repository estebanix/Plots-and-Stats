# ðŸ“Š Archaeological Data Visualization & Statistics

## Overview  
This repository contains various Python-based **plots, visualizations, and statistical analyses** developed for my thesis. The scripts utilize **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy** to explore patterns in archaeological datasets, particularly related to **isotopic analysis, demographic composition, and temporal trends**.  

While originally created for my specific research, these visualizations and statistical techniques can be useful for other archaeology students, researchers, or anyone interested in data-driven insights in archaeology, since they are mostly design to visualize common archaeological data, like f.e. demography vs phases.

The repository is not finished yet (just like this README file), so stay tunedâ€”I will be adding more progressively.
